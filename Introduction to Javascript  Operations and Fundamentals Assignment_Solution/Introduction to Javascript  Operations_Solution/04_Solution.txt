Question 4: What is the purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript, and how do you declare them using the 'let' keyword?

Ans:-

In JavaScript, variables are used to store data values. Declaring a variable means creating a name for the variable so that it can be used in the program. The data stored in a variable can be changed during the execution of the program.

The let keyword is used to declare a variable in JavaScript. It was introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and is now considered the standard way to declare variables. let allows you to declare variables that are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression in which they are used, unlike var which declares a variable globally or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.

Here's how you can declare variables using the let keyword:

let name = 'John Doe';
let age = 25;
let isEmployed = true;
