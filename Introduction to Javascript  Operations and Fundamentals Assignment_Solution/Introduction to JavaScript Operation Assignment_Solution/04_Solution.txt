Discuss the precedence and associativity of operators in JavaScript. Why is understanding these concepts important?

Ans:-

Operator precedence in JavaScript determines how operators are parsed concerning each other. Operators with higher precedence become the operands of operators with lower precedence. For example, in the expression 2 + 3 * 4, the multiplication (*) operator has higher precedence than the addition (+) operator, so 3 * 4 is computed first, and its result is then added to 2.

Associativity determines the order in which operators with the same precedence are processed. For example, consider the expression a = b = 5. The assignment operator (=) has right-to-left associativity, so b = 5 is processed first, and then a is assigned the result.

Understanding these concepts is important because they affect how an expression involving more than one operator is evaluated. Misunderstanding operator precedence and associativity can lead to unexpected results.

Here's an example of operator precedence and associativity in JavaScript:

let a = 2 + 3 * 4; // a is 14, not 20 because * has higher precedence than +
let b;
let c = b = 5; // c and b are both 5 because = has right-to-left associativity
