Question 5: Explain the importance of comments in JavaScript and provide examples of single-line and multi-line comments.

Ans:-
 

Comments in JavaScript are important for several reasons:

1. Readability: They make your code more understandable for others and for yourself, especially when you revisit your code after a long time.

2. Explanation of Logic: They allow you to describe what you are trying to accomplish with your code, which can be particularly helpful if the code is complex.

3. Debugging: They can be used to prevent execution of code while debugging.

JavaScript supports both single-line and multi-line comments:

1. Single-line comments: They start with //. Everything to the right of // on the same line is considered a comment.

// This is a single-line comment
let x = 5; // You can also put comments at the end of a line

2. Multi-line comments: They start with /* and end with */. Everything between /* and */ is considered a comment.

/* This is a
   multi-line
   comment */
