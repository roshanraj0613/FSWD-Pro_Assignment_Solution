Question 6: Explain the importance of choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript. Provide an example where using a clear identifier improves code readability.

Ans:-

Choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript, or any programming language, is crucial for several reasons:

1. Readability: Descriptive variable names make the code easier to read and understand. They make the code self-explanatory, reducing the need for comments.

2. Maintainability: It's easier to maintain and update the code in the future. Other developers who might work on the code can understand the purpose of each variable quickly.

3. Avoid Errors: Meaningful names help prevent bugs. When variable names accurately describe what they contain, there's less chance of using the wrong variable.

Here's an example to illustrate this:

Less Descriptive Variable Names:

let d = new Date();
let y = d.getFullYear();
let m = d.getMonth();

Descriptive Variable Names:

let currentDate = new Date();
let currentYear = currentDate.getFullYear();
let currentMonth = currentDate.getMonth();
