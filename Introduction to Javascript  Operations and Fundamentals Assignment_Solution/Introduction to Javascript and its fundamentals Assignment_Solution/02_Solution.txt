Question 2: Explain the key differences between JavaScript and HTML. Provide examples of situations where you would use each.

Ans:-

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and JavaScript are both essential to web development, but they serve different purposes.

1. HTML: HTML is a markup language used for structuring content on the web. It defines the structure of web content and has elements like headings, paragraphs, divs, spans, links, forms, etc. HTML is not a programming language; it doesn't have logic, it can't perform calculations or manipulate data.

Example Use: You would use HTML to create the structure of a webpage, such as headers, body text, links, images, forms, etc.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <a href="https://www.example.com">This is a link</a>
</body>
</html>

2. JavaScript: JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that adds interactivity to websites. It can update and change both HTML and CSS, calculate, manipulate and validate data.

Example Use: You would use JavaScript to make your website interactive, such as creating a dropdown menu, changing the website content based on user actions, validating form inputs, fetching data from a server, etc.

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello, World!";
