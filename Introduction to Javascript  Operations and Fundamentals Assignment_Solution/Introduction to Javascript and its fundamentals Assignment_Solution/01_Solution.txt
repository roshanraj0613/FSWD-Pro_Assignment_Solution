Question 1: Explain what JavaScript is and its role in web development.

Ans:- 

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is primarily used for building interactive features on websites. It is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.

JavaScript enables the creation of dynamic and interactive web applications. It allows for features like updating content in real-time, interactive maps, animated graphics, scrolling videos, and more.

In web development, JavaScript plays a crucial role in the front-end development for interactivity and user experience. It manipulates the DOM to add, delete or change HTML elements and attributes. It also plays a significant role in back-end development with environments like Node.js.

Moreover, JavaScript is used in mobile application development (React Native, Ionic), desktop applications (Electron.js), and game development. It's a versatile and ever-evolving language with a large community and support.
