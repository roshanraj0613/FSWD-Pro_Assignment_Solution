What are conditional statements? Explain conditional statements with syntax and examples.

Ans. Conditional statements in programming are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. They are a way for programs to make decisions. The most common types of conditional statements are if, else if, and else.

Here's a basic syntax in JavaScript:

if (condition1) {
  // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
}


Here's an example:

let number = 15;

if (number > 10) {
  console.log("The number is greater than 10.");
} else if (number < 10) {
  console.log("The number is less than 10.");
} else {
  console.log("The number is exactly 10.");
}
