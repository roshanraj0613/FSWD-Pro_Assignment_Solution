Explain the usage of ternary operator with syntax and write a program to check whether the number is even or odd using the ternary operator.

Ans:- 

The ternary operator is a concise way to make decisions in your JavaScript code. It's a one-liner replacement for the if-else statement. The syntax for the ternary operator is:

condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;

Here, condition is the condition to check. If condition is true, expressionIfTrue is executed. If condition is false, expressionIfFalse is executed.

Here's a JavaScript program that uses the ternary operator to check whether a number is even or odd:

let number = 7; // Change this value to test with different numbers
let result = (number % 2 === 0) ? 'even' : 'odd';

console.log(`The number is ${result}`);
