Improving the accessibility of HTML involves making web content more inclusive and usable for people with disabilities. Here are three key ways to enhance HTML accessibility:

1. Use Semantic HTML Elements: Semantic HTML elements provide meaning and structure to web content. By using appropriate HTML elements like headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.), lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`), and semantic elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`), you create a well-structured document that is easier for screen readers and other assistive technologies to interpret. Semantic HTML also helps improve navigation and comprehension for all users.

2. Provide Alternative Text for Images: Images should always include descriptive alternative text using the `alt` attribute. This alt text provides information about the image for users who cannot see it, such as screen reader users. Meaningful alt text should convey the purpose or content of the image. For decorative or non-essential images, you can use empty or null alt text (`alt=""`) to indicate that the image is purely decorative.

3. Implement ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) Roles and Attributes: ARIA is a set of attributes and roles that can be added to HTML elements to improve accessibility, particularly for dynamic and interactive web content (e.g., web applications). You can use ARIA roles like `role="button"`, `role="navigation"`, and `role="alert"` to provide additional information to assistive technologies and enhance user interaction. ARIA attributes like `aria-label` and `aria-describedby` can also be used to provide accessible labels and descriptions for elements.
