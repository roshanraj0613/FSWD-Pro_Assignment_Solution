HTML5 is the latest version of the HyperText Markup Language, the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. It was introduced in 2012 and has been widely adopted by modern web browsers.

HTML5 includes a number of new features and improvements over previous versions of HTML, such as:

* **Semantic elements:** HTML5 introduces new semantic elements, such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, and `<article>`. These elements help to make web pages more meaningful to both users and search engines.
* **Multimedia support:** HTML5 includes native support for audio and video playback, without the need for third-party plugins such as Adobe Flash.
* **Canvas element:** The canvas element allows developers to create dynamic graphics and animations using JavaScript.
* **Geolocation API:** The geolocation API allows developers to access the user's current location, with the user's permission.
* **Local storage:** Local storage allows developers to store data on the user's computer, even when the user is offline.
* **Web workers:** Web workers allow developers to run scripts in the background, without blocking the main thread of the web page.
* **Drag and drop API:** The drag and drop API allows developers to create elements that can be dragged and dropped by users.
* **Form enhancements:** HTML5 introduces a number of new form controls, such as the `<input type="email">` and `<input type="date">` controls.
* **Web sockets:** Web sockets allow developers to create real-time bidirectional communication between a web page and a server.

In addition to these features, HTML5 also includes a number of other improvements, such as better support for responsive design and improved accessibility.

HTML5 is a powerful and versatile markup language that allows developers to create rich and interactive web experiences. It is the standard markup language for the modern web.
