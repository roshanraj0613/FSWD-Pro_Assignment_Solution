Explain what .gitignore is and why itâ€™s important in version control

Ans:-

.gitignore is a special file used by Git that specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. These are typically files that you don't want to include in your repository, such as:

- System files or OS generated files like .DS_Store on macOS.
- Log files, local databases, or other files generated by your application.
- Personal IDE configuration files.
- Dependency folders, like node_modules in JavaScript projects, which can be re-created by running npm install.
- Sensitive information, such as passwords or API keys, which should not be publicly accessible.

The importance of .gitignore in version control includes:

1. Clean Repository: It helps to keep your repository clean by excluding files that are not directly related to the project's source code.

2. Reduced Conflicts: It reduces potential conflicts and distractions by ignoring files that can change often or are user-specific.

3. Security: It helps to prevent committing sensitive data to the repository.

Here's an example of a .gitignore file for a Node.js project:

# .gitignore
node_modules/
*.log
.DS_Store
.env
