Relative positioning is a type of positioning where an element is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow. When an element is relatively positioned, it still takes up space in the document flow, but can be moved from its normal position using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. The element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor element, or the initial containing block if there is no positioned ancestor.

Absolute positioning, on the other hand, is a type of positioning where an element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor element, or the initial containing block if there is no positioned ancestor. When an element is absolutely positioned, it is taken out of the document flow and does not take up space in the normal flow of the document. The element can be positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties.

The main difference between absolute and relative positioning is that with absolute positioning, the element is taken out of the document flow and does not affect the position of other elements on the page. With relative positioning, the element still takes up space in the document flow and can affect the position of other elements on the page.
